# TODO: Image Optimization Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive image optimization features for the SEO Toolkit plugin including:
- Automatic alt text generation
- Image file name optimization
- Dynamic Open Graph image generation
- Lazy loading implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze current project structure and dependencies
- [x] Understand existing SEO features and integration patterns
- [x] Create detailed implementation plan

## Pending Tasks

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] Add image optimization settings to settings.yaml
- [ ] Update SettingConfigGetter.java to include image optimization config
- [x] Create ImageOptimizationService.java for core image processing
- [ ] Implement AltTextGenerator.java for AI-powered alt text generation
- [ ] Create ImageFileOptimizer.java for SEO-friendly file naming
- [ ] Implement DynamicOGImageGenerator.java for social media images
- [ ] Add LazyLoadingProcessor.java for performance optimization
- [x] Integrate image optimization with TimeFactorProcess.java
- [ ] Add image processing dependencies to build.gradle

### Frontend Implementation
- [x] Create Vue components for image optimization UI
- [ ] Implement ImageOptimizationPanel.vue for settings management
- [ ] Create ImagePreview.vue for dynamic OG image preview
- [ ] Add lazy loading directives and components
- [ ] Update ui/src/index.ts to register new components
- [ ] Create image optimization dashboard in console

### Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test alt text generation with various image types
- [ ] Validate SEO-friendly file naming conventions
- [ ] Test dynamic OG image generation
- [ ] Verify lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Performance testing for image processing
- [ ] Integration testing with existing SEO features

### Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Update README.md with image optimization features
- [ ] Add configuration documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for image optimization settings
- [ ] Test plugin build and deployment
- [ ] Verify compatibility with Halo platform

## Technical Requirements
- Java 17+ for backend processing
- Vue 3 for frontend components
- Image processing libraries (Apache Commons Imaging, Thumbnailator)
- AI integration for alt text generation (OpenAI API or similar)
- Canvas API for dynamic image generation
- Intersection Observer for lazy loading

## Configuration Options
- Enable/disable automatic alt text generation
- Configure AI service for alt text (API keys, models)
- Set image naming conventions and patterns
- Configure OG image dimensions and templates
- Enable/disable lazy loading with customizable thresholds
- Set image optimization quality and format preferences

## Integration Points
- TimeFactorProcess.java: Main processing pipeline
- SettingConfigGetter.java: Configuration management
- settings.yaml: User settings interface
- Vue components: Admin console interface
- Halo's image attachment system: Source of images to optimize
